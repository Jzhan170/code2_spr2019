# Agenda 
1. Review hw questions
2. Intro to OOP 
4. Activity - draw out a class 
5. Live-coding
6. In-class partner programming 


## OOP Review


#### Procedural programming
Problems are broken down into steps. 


#### Object oriented programming 
Problems are broken down into data types and actions for those data types. 


#### Why do we use OOP?
1. Reusability 
2. Modularity 
3. Easy to maintain and modify 
4. Data security 


## Class structure 

#### NAME
#### DATA
#### CONSTRUCTOR 
#### METHODS


## Encapsulation 
A class along with it’s attributes and methods form one single encapsulated unit. This way the object’s variables can be hidden and only be read by the methods of that class. This offers security and modularity to the code. Use the methods to manipulate the variables instead of doing so externally and directly. This is done by declaring the variables as ‘private’. If not mentioned, they are ‘public’ by default ie they are visible from anywhere and can be manipulated externally.


## Inheritance? 
If a class overlaps in structure with an existing class, we can use the concept of inheritance. The derived (new) class has all of the properties (variables and methods) of the base (existing) class along with some additional properties. 

Subclass = object that inherits from another. 
Superclass = class the sublcass inherits from. 

"Sublcass extends the superclass."


## Homework
1. Create a class with at least 2 different methods
2. Use input (mouse, keys) to change a variable in your class 
3. Create instances of your class: a single object, an array of object, and an arraylist of objects
3. Set up a sublcass with at least 3 methods (just one more class than your superclass)
