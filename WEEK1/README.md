### Git & Github 
#### What is git? 
Put simply, a distributed version control system. Allowing you to save and keep track of versions of your code, revert to a previous version, and recover changes. 

Working directory = your folder on your computer 
Staging area = prepping files to be added 
Local repository = your git file that will be pushed to...

Remote repository = the repository you set up on a server (we use github put there are other platforms that you can use like sourcetree or bitbucket)

### BREAK AND TROUBLESHOOTING GIT

### Practice review questions 

##### Question 1. 

Set up an "interface" that display a string of text from a string array.

Psuedocode: 
1. Set up string array 
2. Set up displayText function 
3. Draw 4 circles to the canvas 
4. Store circle postions in a postion array 
5. Calculate distance between the mouse and your circles 
6. Use a conditional to check if distance is withing the area of the circle, then change the index position in the string array 

##### Question 2. 
Use the map function to map the background gradient to the X and Y mouse positions.

##### Question 3. 
Set up a 2 dimentional array of rectangles. Change color (only one time!) of an individual square from white to a random color. 


HINT you'll need a boolean array 

##### Question 4. 
Use trig functions to oscillate an ellipse horizontally, then change to vertically whenever it is clicked on.
